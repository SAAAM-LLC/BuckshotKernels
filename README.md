# BuckshotKernels
BuckshotKernels — Custom CUDA &amp; SIMD C matrix/convolution kernels for ternary neural nets. Built in the wild. No frameworks. No hand-holding. Just pure, unfiltered hardware ass-kicking for {-1,0,1} math.  “When you want your models faster than a greased hog on a slip’n’slide and twice as dirty.”
